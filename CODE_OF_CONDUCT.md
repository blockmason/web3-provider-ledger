# Code of Conduct

We aim to foster a **professional** environment for community members of all
levels of experience and demographic identifiers. For us, this fundamentally
means **being respectful to each other**, even when we have differing opinions,
viewpoints, or skill levels.

Qualities that we view to be exemplary in our community include:

 * Upholding the highest standards of ethics for ourselves and others

 * Having focused and meaningful conversations

 * Proactively inviting feedback and criticism for ideas and contributions

 * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism, even when uninvited

 * Focusing on what is best for the community

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project email
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at <abuse@blockmason.io>. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
