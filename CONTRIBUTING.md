## Found a bug?

We want to fix it!

Create a GitHub issue and make sure it has the **bug** label.

Please take some time to be as detailed as you can so that we have enough context
to reproduce the issue. The more context you can provide up front, the more quickly
we can identify (and hopefully, resolve) the issue.

## Have a great feature idea?

Wonderful! Let's hear it.

Create a GitHub issue and make sure it has the **feature** label.

## Looking for something to do?

Generally, if you happen to come across something that you think
needs to be done and/or would benefit this project, then by all
means, go ahead and do it. If there isn't an open GitHub issue,
yet, and the work is non-trivial to perform, then please create
one.

### Want to write some code?

Feel free to pick off any open GitHub issue with the **ready** label.
These issues have been approved by a member of the core team and should
have enough context to get started toward resolving.

### Want to review some code?

Look for open Pull Requests. As a bonus, code reviews can provide an
excellent way to learn the codebase and design patterns within it.

### Want to write some documentation?

Great!
