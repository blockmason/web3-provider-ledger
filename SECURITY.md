# Security

We take the security of our software very seriously. If you believe you have
found a vulnerability, please let us know as soon as possible. We believe that
a *responsible disclosure* process is mutually beneficial to both security
researchers and software project maintainers, while also providing optimal
benefit to users of the affected software.

## How it works

 * Submit your initial report as a PGP-encrypted email to <security@blockmason.io>.

 * We will assign your report a case number in our incident reporting software
   and invite you to this case as a participant.

 * We will work together toward a resolution. For you, this may mean providing
   additional details around your findings to help us identify the conditions in
   which the vulnerability can be found, and whether this class of vulnerability
   may be present elsewhere within our software.

 * Any information disclosed in your report, at any time, may be publicly disclosed
   within 60 days of its disclosure to us, regardless of when the initial report
   was submitted.

 * After the case is resolved, we will endeavor to facilitate public disclosure
   prior to the 60-day waiting period.

## Our commitment to you

 * We believe in responsible disclosure, and will agree to *public disclosure*
   after we have had a reasonable amount of time to patch the vulnerability
   and protect users of our software.

 * We believe in giving due credit. With your permission, your name and a link
   to your public disclosure will be included in this document.

 * This project is a labor of love from a community of contributors, so we cannot
   provide financial compensation for your work.
